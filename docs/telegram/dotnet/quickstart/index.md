## Quickstart
Before you start developing a bot, you need to talk to [```@BotFather```](https://t.me/botfather)
on Telegram. Register a bot with him and get an access token.
Access token is a key used to identify and authorize your bot
in API requests so keep it with yourself as a secret. It looks like this: 
```

``` 
Now you have a bot, it's time to bring it to life! Create a new console
project for your bot. It could be a .NET Core project or a .NET project targeting versions 4.5+.
